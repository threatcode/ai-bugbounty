        Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. Your insights and observations are valuable to us. However, the issue you've reported pertains to policy or content complaints, and as such, it falls outside the purview of our bug bounty program, which is focused on security vulnerabilities.

        We take your concerns seriously and want to address them appropriately. Please direct your report to our content moderation or policy team through [link to appropriate page or email]. They are well-equipped to handle these matters and ensure that our platform maintains a respectful and inclusive environment.
